# 🎯 Agent-R: AI-Powered Pentesting Agent

A hybrid pentesting agent with TLS-encrypted C2, AI-powered autonomous attack mode, and interactive AI assistant.

## Features

- **🔒 TLS Encrypted C2** - All shell communications encrypted with SSL/TLS
- **🤖 AI Autonomous Mode** - DeepSeek Coder 7B decides attack chain automatically
- **💬 AI Assistant** - Tell the AI what you want in plain English
- **🔐 Persistence** - Multiple methods (Startup, Registry, Secure folder)
- **🔑 Credential Theft** - WiFi passwords, browser credentials, Windows Vault
- **📺 Live Monitor** - Real-time screen capture stream
- **🛡️ Evasion** - Variable obfuscation, LOLBin execution

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Ollama (for AI features)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b

# Run the agent
python3 hybrid_agent.py
```

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Get Shell
1. Agent starts HTTP server + TLS listener
2. Send link to target: `http://YOUR_IP:8080/`
3. Target runs the command shown
4. Shell connects with TLS encryption

### Phase 2: Post-Exploitation
```
[1] 🔐 Install Persistence
[2] �� Steal Data  
[3] ⬆️  Privilege Escalation
[4] 💻 Raw Shell
[5] 🔄 Wait for Reconnect
[6] 🤖 AI Autonomous Mode    ← AI attacks automatically
[7] 💬 AI Assistant          ← Tell AI what to do
```

## AI Features

### Autonomous Mode
AI automatically performs:
- Reconnaissance (whoami, hostname, privileges)
- Persistence installation
- Credential extraction

### Assistant Mode
Type natural language commands:
```
> find all wifi passwords
🧠 AI generates: netsh wlan show profiles | ...
> check if I'm admin
🧠 AI generates: whoami /priv
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenSSL (for TLS cert generation)
- Ollama (for AI features)
- AWS/VPS: Ports 8080, 4444 open
